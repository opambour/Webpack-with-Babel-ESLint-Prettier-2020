# Webpack with Babel, ESLint & Prettier 2020

### Webpack

**Webpack** is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.

### Babel 

**Babel** is a Javascript compiler. It transpiles or compiles ES Next code to ES5 standardized code.

> . babel-core: Transforms your ES6 code into ES5. <br>
> . babel-loader: Webpack helper to transform your JavaScript dependencies (for example, when you import your components into other components) with Babel. <br>
> . babel-preset-env: Determines which transformations/plugins to use and polyfills (provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it) based on the browser matrix you want to support.

### ESLint and Prettier

**Prettier** takes care of your code formatting, **ESLint** takes care of your code style.
